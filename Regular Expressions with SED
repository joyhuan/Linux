# Regular Expressions with SED
A regular expression is a string that can be used to describe several sequences of characters. 
Regular expressions are used by several different Unix commands, including ed, sed, awk, grep, 
and to a more limited extent, vi. 

SED stands for stream editor. This stream-oriented editor was created exclusively for executing 
scripts. Thus, all the input you feed into it passes through and goes to STDOUT and it does not 
change the input file.
