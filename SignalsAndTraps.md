## Sending Signals
One of the most common is for a user to type CONTROL-C or the INTERRUPT key while a script is executing.

When you press the Ctrl+C key, a SIGINT is sent to the script and as per defined default action script terminates.

The other common method for delivering signals is to use the kill command, the syntax of which is as follows âˆ’
```
$ kill -signal pid
```
